# My Personal Website
A couple of days into designing and coding my website up, I really wished that i put this file into good use, but nonetheless this is a valuble learning opportunity. Rather, I might just record the lessons which I've learnt in my first attempt at building a personal webpage. 

## Plan. Plan. PLAN. 
I cannot for the life of me remember how I envisioned by website. Ideas have been thrown around, discarded, changed and recycled. It would've definitely helped to have a recorded plan for my webpage instead of more often than not blindely testing ideas which come across my mind. In my experience, it has created much unnecessary stress and chaos. Don't hesitate to have multiple js and css files as they can get quite long and confusing to manage.

I've had my fair share of naming variables. In the beginning they don't seem so bad but as the code grows, when you have to commit new code, change old code and everything in between it becomes quite a nightmare when you have a button named *sidebarscrollbuttontomovetocontentsection*. And no, adding underscores and capitals won't make it better, even intellisense will have a hard time with that name. Also, future me **PLEASE** have a system for when you use a class and when you use an ID. I know for the most they are interchangable but its just so confusing in a long run so make. a. system. thanks. 

## get...tested?
I think it goes without saying that Chrome is far superior to other browsers for webdev due to it's developer tools which have helped me greatly but the amount of times that I have regretted not testing on at least Safari or a phone is too many to count. Do this frequently and consistently to make sure you haven't hard coded something which will ruin it on other browsers or platforms (like I have already for this page). 

That's all for now. I'm sure there will be more to come by the end. Hang tight for that. 19.05.23
